# Pop-Test-Not-Quiz

https://github.com/Godzelduh/pop-test-not-quiz

## Description 
An application that provides a useful tool on test taking.
The tests are generated for the user, and they are able to answer the questions in succession.
Once all question have been answered, they will be able to see their results. 
The results are saved, and the user can have the option to go over their passed answers.
The application brings in more questions when the user wants to complete a new quiz, 
or even retake one at any point of their choice.
We hope that anyone who decides to use this application, can find great benefits in their 
test taking experiences, and to continue to reuse it over time.
